# NFT Project. Mint your own NFT

Stop hating this thing, hate ppl who take advantage of the ignorance.

I used hardhat, you can find this tutorial on https://buildspace.so . It is actually pretty interesting.

You can see my online (in testnet) contract in [here](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x1a509030409fd7b4cafb5538007bf0d0bd583ed1)

See the minted Tokens in [Rarible](https://rinkeby.rarible.com/collection/0x1a509030409fd7b4cafb5538007bf0d0bd583ed1/items)

Run this with hardhat!
```
npx hardhat scripts/run.js
```
```
npx hardhat scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
```

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
